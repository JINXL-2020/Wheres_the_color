### Description

When we talk about Lost & Found, we tend to believe they are two contradictory states. But what if they’re not? Sometimes You found when you lost.

Where’s the color is a role-playing puzzle game developed by Team No_Bad_Heart. In the world without color, you need to defeat the enemy to find the color which would lead you to the exit.

In this game, your mood points match with three different states: black, grey and white. These mood points represents both your Hit Point and your Magic Point used to shoot the enemy and barriers. When you lost your mood points, the state of the world would change with it. In this game, lost and found follow each other like a shadow, one complements the other.

You can use the WSAD keys on the keyboard to control the character to move in four directions: up, down, left, right and click the left mouse button to shoot once you got the weapon. Attacks consume mood points. When you defeat the enemy, the color would come back to the world and lead you to the exist.

**简介**

通常我们认为失去和找到是两个矛盾的状态，如果它们不是呢？失去也有可能会带来新的收获

Where’s the color是一款由No_Bad_Heart团队开发的解密冒险游戏。在这个没有色彩的世界里，玩家需要使用武器打败怪物、找回颜色才能发现出口。

玩家的心情值指向黑白灰三种不同的状态，心情值既代表着玩家的生命数，同时也是玩家攻击使用的能量，当心情值下降时状态也会随之改变，玩家所能看到的世界也会发生变化。在这个游戏中失去和找到是一对影子，它们互为代价，互为补充。

玩家可以通过键盘上WSAD键控制人物上下左右移动，拾取武器后可以点击鼠标左键攻击，攻击会消耗心情值。打败怪物后，玩家就能找回颜色从而找到出口。
